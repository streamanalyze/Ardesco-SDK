grove_i2c application
###############

The grove_i2c application demonstrates using the grove connector configured
as a I2C bus. 

To use the application, connect a seeedstudio Grove-I2C High Accuracy Temp&Humi
Sensor (SHT35) to the grove connector.

The application initializes the sensor and reports the temperature and humidity
out the debug console. Because this example uses the Grove connector on the
Combi Dev, that is the only platform that runs this example.
